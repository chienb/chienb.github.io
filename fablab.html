          <h2>The Challenge/Problem</h2>
          <p>The Fabrication Lab (Fablab) is a department within CSUDH which brings Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) to
          the forefront of K-16 education through leadership and service. One of the most important projects is the fleet of mobile fabrication labs. These trucks
          tow around customized mobile trailers outfitted with the state-of-the-art fabrication equipment to classrooms and communities, providing and inspiring
          young engineers and inventors with hands-on experience.</p>
          <div class="col s12">
            <div class="card" style="box-shadow: none">
              <div class="card-image"><img src="img/fablab-equipment.jpg"></div>
            </div>
          </div>
          <p>The Fablab needed an appealing landing page that would generate interest when users browse the website and ultimately encourage them
          to submit an application for the trailers to visit their school/community.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col s12">
          <h2>Approach</h2>
          <p>It was clear that the community was interested in the project when it was first announced, but the public had no idea what the
          trailer or equipment looked like. It's hard to get excited about something you can't see or touch (yet). Therefore, it made sense to show images of the
          trailer with a brief description for each of the fabrication equipment. This will allow kids to look up and research the equipment before visiting the
          mobile Fablab. They will have the opportunity to prepare questions and have them answered through a hands-on experience by the staff.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col s12">
          <h2>Design</h2><strong class="inner-text">Typography</strong>
          <p>I picked only 2 typefaces to keep the interface consistent and simple. I chose Open Sans for the body elements because it is easy on
          the eyes. Sans serif typefaces, which lack the ligatures appended to the end of serif strokes, are often easier to read on the web. The shapes are much
          simpler and easier to comprehend.</p>
          <p>It wasn't easy trying to find the typeface for heading elements. I was looking for a futuristic and tech-oriented font which will
          fit the context of Fablab. So I browsed <a href="fontpair.co">fontpair.co</a> to look for inspirations. I was finally able to settle on 2 options, Ubuntu
          or Raleway. I chose Raleway because it was originally designed for headings and other large size usage.</p>

            <div class="card" style="box-shadow: none">
              <div class="card-image"><img src="img/fablab-typography-1.jpg"></div>
            </div>
          </div>
          <div class="col s12 l6">
            <div class="card" style="box-shadow: none">
              <div class="card-image"><img src="img/fablab-typography-2.jpg"></div>
            </div>
          </div><strong>Wireframe</strong>
          <p>I created a rough wireframe to kickstart some ideas. I like to do this because it helps me visualize the flow of different layouts
          from a top-down view. Sometimes we get caught up in the small details we lose vision of the bigger picture. The <em>introduction block</em> is the
          section for your "elevator pitch" - a clear statement or image of what your website is about. This area will be mostly information, so I included a brief
          description of the Fablab and some stats to add a little more depth.</p>
          <p>The next section is what I like to call <em>"features"</em>. We see a lot of these on the landing pages of ecommerce
          websites. They usually highlight the features of the products with big callouts and images; the nitty-gritty details that will entice you to buy the
          product. In our case, the fabrication equipment are the "features" of the mobile Fablab product.</p>
          <p>The <em>supplementary block</em> is an area for any additional information you would like to include on the website. This
          would be a great section to include a gallery or testimonial to re-engage the user to perform a specific action such as register, donate, purchase,
          etc.</p>
          <p>The <em>end block</em> usually contains the CTA element and the footer of the website. For our project, we want to thank our
          sponsors for their support - by displaying their logos above the footer section.</p>

        <div class="col s12">
          <h2>Reflection</h2>
          <p>Nothing is more true than the phrase "a picture paints/is worth a thousand words", even in web design. Pictures have the power to
          create an emotional response in the audience, faster than text. A properly designed website can manipulate the audience to feel whatever it wants them to
          feel.</p>
          <p>The new Fablab landing page was able to generate a lot of buzz and interest in the community through meaningful and informative
          imagery.</p>
